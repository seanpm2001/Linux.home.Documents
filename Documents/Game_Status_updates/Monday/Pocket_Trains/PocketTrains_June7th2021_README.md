# Pocket Trains session June 7th 2021

I had an very long session today, and eventually forced myself to quit. I made some progress today, and finished exploring the world.

## New railroads

I did not build any new railroads today, and I did not create any new engines or fuel cars.

## Bux

I didn't save up very much bux today compared to last week. The game didn't give me very many ads.

## Asia exploration

I finished exploring Asia today, exploring 3 capitals on the island of Japan. I have now explored the entire world in this game. All that is left is the to and from railways across various oceans.

## South America exploration

I didn't explore South America today.

## Oceania exploration

I did not do any exploring in Oceania today.

## Africa routing

I am working on re-routing Africa, so my train that reaches the Nordic region of Europe can stop going so far into Africa. I didn't make progress on this goal again today.

## Revenue

I did worse on revenue today.

## Overall routing

I put many miles on all my trains today, and wore most of them out before quitting.

## Level progress

I made some progress in level 14 today, surpassing 1 million total XP.

## Overview

See above.
